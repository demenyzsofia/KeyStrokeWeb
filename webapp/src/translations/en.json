One is a histogram of features, which is constructed using all user values; the other is a line graph of typing rhythms, which is constructed using the typing data of one user. By default, the histograms are loaded and sapipin is the default dataset.",
            "performance": "The performance analysis option gives you two options: Detector category and Detector menu option. The first option gives you the datasets and detector categories. The user can select a dataset and a category and, depending on these, can plot the performance of the detectors in that category by ROC roll for the selected dataset. Furthermore, he can also view another type of chart, namely box plots, which also reflect the performance of detectors. The dataset selected by default is sapipin and the detector category is Linear Models. In the case where the Detector sub-menu item is selected, the datasets disappear from the page, leaving only the detectors in the category for the user to choose from ( any detector ). The box plots displayed visualise the AUC , then EER values of the selected detector as the five datasets, thus comparing performance. The default selected detector is PCA."
